        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-4 px-4">
          I'm an AI Developer passionate about building responsible and impactful AI solutions for the public sector. Currently serving with the <a href="https://it.nc.gov" target="_blank" class="underline">North Carolina Department of Information Technology</a>, I design and prototype advanced AI applications leveraging large language models, AI agents, and machine learning frameworks while guiding strategic adoption across state agencies. My role spans building proof-of-concepts and pilot applications, evaluating emerging technologies such as synthetic data and digital twins, and advising teams on responsible integration of AI into government services. I contribute to establishing AI governance frameworks and practical policies that prioritize ethics, security, and transparency, helping lead innovation efforts that ensure North Carolina's AI initiatives remain accountable, impactful, and citizen-focused.
          <br><br>
          My technical expertise spans Python, JavaScript, and full-stack development, with specialized experience in AI-driven solutions and scalable digital systems. Through my work at <a href="https://triunecreative.com" target="_blank" class="underline">Triune Creative</a>, I've led web design and media projects for nonprofits and small businesses, focusing on user-friendly, client-centric designs. My development experience also includes work at various startups engineering AI-enhanced workflows, optimizing ERP systems, and leveraging cloud infrastructure to improve software performance.
          <br><br>
          Beyond coding, I have a diverse range of interests and experiences that shape who I am. I was homeschooled, which gave me the flexibility to develop a deep love for learning and problem-solving. Music is also a significant part of my life - I've played piano since I was four and currently <a href="https://sophisticatedsoundandkeys.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">play weddings</a>. In my free time, I enjoy reading, particularly books on apologetics, allegories, and historical fiction.
